# üéì Student Exam Score Predictor

A simple web application built using Streamlit that predicts student exam scores. It utilizes a CatBoost regression model trained on data encompassing student demographics, academic habits, and lifestyle factors.

## ‚ú® Features

* Interactive web form for inputting student data using sliders, dropdowns, and number inputs.
* Predicts numerical exam scores based on the provided inputs.
* Applies necessary preprocessing and feature engineering consistent with model training.
* Clips the final predicted score to a realistic range (15-100).
* Provides a simple interpretation of the predicted score range.
* Utilizes a pre-trained CatBoost model loaded from saved artifacts.
* Features a simple, clean UI with a light green background.

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Details

* **Algorithm:** CatBoost Regressor (`catboost.CatBoostRegressor`)
* **Preprocessing:**
    * **Binary Features** (`part_time_job`, `extracurricular_participation`): Encoded as 1 for 'Yes'/True and 0 for 'No'/False. NaNs defaulted to 0.
    * **Categorical Features** (`gender`, `diet_quality`, `parental_education_level`, `internet_quality`): Handled internally by the CatBoost model. Missing values (`NaN`) during preprocessing were filled with the string `"Missing"` before training and are handled similarly for prediction inputs.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * `wellbeing_index`: Created by applying Min-Max scaling (to range [0, 1]) to `sleep_hours`, `exercise_frequency`, and `mental_health_rating` based on assumed realistic ranges (`SCALING_RANGES` in `app.py`), and then summing these scaled values. Potential NaNs in components were imputed before scaling.
    * `study_consistency`: Calculated as `study_hours_per_day * (attendance_percentage / 100.0)`.
    * `total_screen_time`: Calculated as `netflix_hours + social_media_hours`.
    * The original numerical features used to create these engineered features (`sleep_hours`, `exercise_frequency`, `mental_health_rating`, `study_hours_per_day`, `attendance_percentage`, `netflix_hours`, `social_media_hours`) were **dropped** before training the final model.
* **Prediction Clipping:** Raw model output is clipped to the range \[15.0, 100.0] before being displayed.
